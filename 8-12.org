* This week
- 了解caffe中
- 了解RNN和LSTM
- Why =convolution=
kernel/filter matrix 有滤镜作用

If detecting a horizontal edge is important at some location in the
image, it should intuitively be useful at some other location as well
due to the translationally-invariant structure of images. 
- extract features from cnn
- 配置 =torch= 
* Next week
- 继续学习caffe
- 利用 =imagenet= 训练好的模型，在caffe框架下提取图片的特征
